# COVID-19 Response Network

## Overview

In a nutshell, the COVID-19 Response Network is a system to help fulfill the needs of communities during the pandemic.   

The project was originally inspired by Jae Slaby, a local community organizer in Battle Creek, Michigan that put together a local website that linked to a resource guide and timebank on Google Sheets to help people to seek and offer help, with the goal of connecting people together. Putting this together on to a simple to use website looked to be the solution to this, to keep things user friendly and highly accessible.

## WHAT IT DOES (so far)

The current pilot city, [Battle Creek, Michigan](https://battlecreek.covidresponse.net), includes the first features of the project, which includes ways to offer and receive help through various local organizations.  The site also includes a community resource guide so folks can look up essential services and resources in their area.   Although the site is not meant as a source for news, links to COVID-19 updates are included, including to the WHO, CDC, State, County, and City sites. 

## HOW IT’S BUILT

Simple, we didn’t reinvent the wheel.  We used [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/), which is a highly extendable CMS on the .NET Stack that will work well as the needs change during the pandemic. It is mature, as it has been around since 2005, very developer friendly, and is localizable.

Since each community will have their own set of needs and resources, we wanted something simple enough to train community organizers on how to update the content themselves.
